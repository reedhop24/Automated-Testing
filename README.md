## Automated Headless Testing

#### Since IBQ does not utilize any sort of testing software, I wanted to get a more firm grasp on Unit Testing with Jest, namely Unit Testing utlizing a headless browser and Puppeteer. Therefore I wanted to create a small application to play around with these frameworks. I also had never worked with Passport.js before or the Google OAuth flow so a simple application where a User signs in with Google and is re directed to another page upon signing in seemed like a good fit to work with these back end frameworks.

#### This application is built using Node.Js, Puppeteer, Jest, Express, Mongoose, keygrip, HTML, and CSS.
